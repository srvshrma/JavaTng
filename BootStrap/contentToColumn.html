                <p>It's a little awkward, so we'll get straight to the point: This Wednesday we humbly ask you to defend 
                    Wikipedia's independence. We depend on donations averaging about ₹1,000, but 98% of our readers don’t 
                    give. If everyone reading this gave ₹150, the price of one week’s worth of coffee, we could keep 
                    Wikipedia thriving for years to come. When we made Wikipedia a non-profit, people warned us we'd regret 
                    it.But if Wikipedia became commercial, it would be a great loss to the world. Wikipedia unites all of 
                    us who love knowledge: contributors, readers, and the donors who keep us thriving. The heart and soul 
                    of Wikipedia is a community of people working to bring you unlimited access to reliable, neutral information. 
                    Please take a minute to help us keep Wikipedia online and growing. Thank you.</p></div>
